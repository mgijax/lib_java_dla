CHANGES: TR6176
1) GBFormatInterpreter - Add test for FEATURES tag when looking for REFERENCE tag as some
               RefSeq sequences do not have REFERENCE tag
2) Seqloader - Seqloader.run method must catch MGIException (Not
               RecordFormatException) then test to see if of type
               RecordFormatException when calling iterator.next().

CHANGES: SequenceLookupbug fix - reset all caches (HashSet) with each invocation of interpretRows.
